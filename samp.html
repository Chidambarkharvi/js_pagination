        <label>CSS-The Complete Guide 2022 <span>5 HOURS</span></label>
        
        <p>Short for Cascading Style Sheets - is a "programming language" you use to turn your raw HTML pages into real beautiful websites. 
            This course covers it all - we start at the very basics (What is CSS? How does it work? How do you use it)? and gradually dive in deeper and deeper. And we do this by showing both practical examples as well as the theory behind it.
            Getting started with CSS might look easy but there actually is a lot of depth to CSS - hence this course provides different "Tracks" or "Entry points" to exactly meet your demands and reflect you current knowledge level.
